# Advent of Code 2025

This year I want to try a different approach to tackling the problems, slow and deliberate, inspired by literate programming and metacognition. I'll keep notes on how I'm interpreting the problem description, how I know whatever information I draw upon to solve the problems (if possible), and how I relate it to Uiua glyphs and idioms.

Each day will have a markdown file with the following sections.

## Solving Journal
- Write here first! Solve the problem, THEN write the code.
- Break the problem down into the smallest steps possible.
- Describe the solution in general math and logic first, then talk about Uiua implementation.
- Try to think about how I learned the things I use to solve each step.
- Keep in roadblocks, bugs, backtracks, restarts. This should be more of a "stream of thoughts" section.

## Solution Review
- Describe the solution cleanly, basically distill the stream of thoughts into a clear path to the full solution.
- Consider alternative algorithms for certain steps if possible, compare writing style and benchmark.

## Expansion
- Consider modifications or additions to the problem statement that would make it harder or trickier. Try solving those.
- Look for parts that could become useful reuseable patterns, try to make them work more generally
