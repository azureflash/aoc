First part was extremely easy, both the parsing and calculating the answer. Had to remind myself that drawing isn't needed to answer it! I don't think it could get any simpler but I bet someone on the Uiua discord did it in half the glyphs...

Part 2 looks like it takes a little more math than I'm used to using.
